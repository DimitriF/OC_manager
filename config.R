board = T ## set to T for development purpose if you are not connected to the arduino
pulse_delay_secu = T ## delay max of 20 microseconds for inkjet pulse delay

Drop_vol = 0.15 # in nL, use to calculate volume in Methods

Visu_roi = "0.27,0.2,0.6,0.6"

## need Y and X bias also but we see this later
